# Consumer-Buying-Behavior
This research studies the relationship between some consumer attributes and total spending on different products. A dataset with 2239 distinct clients and 28 characteristics was utilized in the study. The methods for data processing and cleaning included deleting unnecessary columns and imputing missing values using the median. Correlation heat map, basic descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, and multivariate linear regression analysis were then carried out as part of the study. The findings indicate that Year Birth, Education, Income, and TotalKidsAndTeen are statistically significant predictors of TotalAmountSpent, however Marital Status does not seem to be a relevant predictor. These results can be used to guide marketing plans aimed at certain demographic groups, such as younger or older consumers, customers with or without children, customers with higher or lower incomes or educational levels.
